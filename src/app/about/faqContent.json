            "answer": "VPC is a volunteer-run organization which campaigns for inclusive and anti-displacement focused policy. VPC was formed in response to the East End Small Area Plan, which was drafted by the Falls Church City Council and puts forward plans to change Eden Center and the area around it. We felt that the proposal did not do enough to address the present and future needs of tenants in Eden Center, specifically regarding anti-displacement measures."
